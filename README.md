# Iced Docs

Beginner-friendly, documentation website for the Rust GUI crate `iced`, built with **Dioxus 0.7** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## A Disclaimer About AI Usage

This project was initialized with the use of an AI coding agent. This means that it's likely that some of the content is wrong, unhelpful, or incomplete. I tried to get the AI to ground all information with references to the rustdocs and official examples, but only time will tell how well it did with that.

This was done simply to have a quick place to start from with the idea that it can be manually edited and improved over time.

That said, though this whole project is low-priority for me, I will try to update it as I have time / find things wrong with it.
