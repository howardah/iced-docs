# Enum - Never

Authoritative source: `ref/doc/iced/enum.Never.html`.

## Rustdoc summary

The error type for errors that can never happen.

## Verified declaration

```rust
pub enum Never {}
```

## When to use

Use this enum when modeling or configuring the set of discrete variants represented by `iced::...`.

## Why to use

It provides explicit, typed variant semantics that match runtime and widget APIs documented in rustdoc.

## Example References

- ref/examples/geometry/src/main.rs
- ref/examples/websocket/src/echo.rs

## Inline Examples (from rustdoc)

```rust
impl<T, U> TryFrom<U> for T where U: Into<T> {
    type Error = Infallible;

    fn try_from(value: U) -> Result<Self, Infallible> {
        Ok(U::into(value))  // Never returns `Err`
    }
}
```

```rust
pub type Infallible = !;
```

## Use this when...

- You need a typed set of variants for layout/style/runtime behavior.
- You want pattern matching instead of ad-hoc booleans.
- You are configuring widget behavior with explicit choices.

## Minimal example

```rust
// Choose an enum variant and pass it into widget/runtime configuration.
```

## How it works

Enums model constrained strategy choices in Iced APIs. They keep configuration readable and make invalid combinations easier to catch at compile time.

## Common patterns

```rust
// Use match expressions for app-driven variant selection.
```

## Gotchas / tips

- Similar variant names may have different effects across APIs.
- Keep variant selection close to widget config for clarity.
- Confirm semantics in rustdoc for edge cases.
