# Element - Radio

Authoritative source: ref/doc/iced/widget/struct.Radio.html.

## Rustdoc summary

A circular button representing a choice.

## Verified type declaration

```rust
pub struct Radio<'a, Message, Theme = Theme, Renderer = Renderer<Renderer, Renderer>>
where
    Theme: Catalog,
    Renderer: Renderer,{ /* private fields */ }
```

## When to use

Use this element struct when you need direct type-level control over a widget value.

## Why to use

It enables strongly typed composition and explicit builder method flows.

## Example References

- ref/examples/scrollable/src/main.rs

## Inline Examples (from rustdoc)

```rust
use iced::widget::{column, radio};

struct State {
   selection: Option<Choice>,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy)]
enum Message {
    RadioSelected(Choice),
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq)]
enum Choice {
    A,
    B,
    C,
    All,
}

fn view(state: &State) -> Element<'_, Message> {
    let a = radio(
        "A",
        Choice::A,
        state.selection,
        Message::RadioSelected,
    );

    let b = radio(
        "B",
        Choice::B,
        state.selection,
        Message::RadioSelected,
    );

    let c = radio(
        "C",
        Choice::C,
        state.selection,
        Message::RadioSelected,
    );

    let all = radio(
        "All of the above",
        Choice::All,
        state.selection,
        Message::RadioSelected
    );

    column![a, b, c, all].into()
}
```

## Use this when...

- You need the concrete widget struct type in signatures.
- You are debugging type errors involving generic bounds.
- You want lower-level control than constructor-only docs provide.

## Minimal example

```rust
// Constructors usually produce this element type.
// Name the type explicitly only when type-level APIs need it.
```

## How it works

Element structs are the underlying widget types used by constructors. Most app code can stay constructor-first, then use element docs for advanced typing/customization.

## Common patterns

```rust
// Use constructors in normal UI code,
// and reserve explicit element types for reusable abstractions.
```

## Gotchas / tips

- You usually do not need to construct element structs directly.
- Read trait bounds carefully when adding custom renderer/theme types.
- If a method is missing, check the related module page.
